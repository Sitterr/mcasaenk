## Acknowledgment
This program took much inspiration from the many already existing external mappers(and in this regard with MCA Saenk I tried to combine my favorite parts of each one of those tools). The main ones being:
- [MCA Selector](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector)
- [Mapee](https://www.mapee.net/home)
- [mcview](https://github.com/kbinani/mcview)
