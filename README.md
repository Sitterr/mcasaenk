## Notable Features
* **3D shadows:** can render accurate pixel-perfect 3D shades from all angles
* **In-game mapping style:** by calibrating the specific settings, this tool is able to reproduce an exact copy of what minecraft's in-game maps would render
* **Colormaps:** apart from the 4 build-in distinct colormaps/styles(_default_, _java map_, _bedrock map_, _betaplus_), this tool allows the user to create new styles based on resource packs and mods
* **Support for mods and datapacks:** can identify and read custom blocks, biomes, and dimensions defined in datapacks and mods
* **30+ different individual settings:** _contrast_, _lightning_, _shading_, _colormaps_, _biome blending_, _water transluciency_, etc. Most of the customizations happen real-time and do not require a re-render
* **Extensive interface for screenshot capturing:** drag and scale a virtual window representing the screenshot, before capturing. Can also export screenshots as in-game minecraft maps


## Supported Versions
Currently MCA Saenk supports every official Java Edition release from 1.2.1 up to 1.21+.
Additionally, it strives to support modded worlds(Fabric and Forge), making efforts to extract information about custom blocks, as well as biomes(1.16+) and dimensions(1.16+).

## Acknowledgments
This program took much inspiration from the many already existing external mappers(and in this regard with MCA Saenk I tried to combine and build upon my favorite parts of each one of those tools). The main ones being:
- [MCA Selector](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector)
- [Mapee](https://www.mapee.net/home)
